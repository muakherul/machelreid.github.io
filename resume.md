## Experience
### Research Intern - Matsuo Lab, The University of Tokyo
***October 2019 - Present***  
Working on NLP (Natural Language Processing) research at Matsuo Lab, University of Tokyo.

Specifically, I have been working on representation learning, using variational inference for learning natural language edit representations and transfer learning methods for better word embeddings for morphologically rich low resource languages.

Youngest member of the lab - 15yrs (at time of internship)
### Research Intern - Numada Lab, IIS, The University of Tokyo
***June 2019 - September 2019***  
Worked on the development of a machine learning based system for accelerated disaster inquiry responses and for ease of access to information in natural disaster situations.

Youngest member of the lab 14yrs - (at time of internship)
### Researcher - Thomson Reuters Foundation
***May 2019 - June 2019***  
Translated TRF's survey regarding social entrepreneurs and conducted research with companies across Japan to be incorporated into the global study. [[Study Website](http://poll2019.trust.org/){:target="_blank"}] 

***September 2018***  
Conducted research about women-only carriages with Tokyoites in Japanese. Article featured on the World Economic Forum, Japan Times, Thomson Reuters. [[Article](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/11/women-in-tokyo-strongly-back-single-sex-transport-amid-security-fears/){:target="_blank"}]

***August 2018 - September 2018***  
Conducted research about 200 women's views on transportation in Tokyo over 5 days for TRF. Afterwards, developed graphs and visual representations of the data for easy consumption. [[Study Website](http://2018transportpoll.trust.org/city/tokyo/){:target="_blank"}]

## Awards
### Masason Foundation Scholar
***July 2020 - Present***  
Accepted to the [Masason Foundation](https://masason-foundation.org/en/){:target="_blank"}, which supports youth with high aspirations and exceptional talents

### Grand Prize Winner - Rakuten Technology Conference Hackathon 2018
***Oct 2018***  
Our team ('No-name') developed a prototype matchmaking app between babysitters and working parents - Supernannies. This was made to combat problems that working women face in Japan today (career or children?). Out of all 10, carefully-reviewed projects, our team was chosen as the winner.

The app was developed in React Native, with [Google] Firebase as backend. Utilized Rakuten's RapidAPI marketplace to easily access and manage several powerful APIs.
